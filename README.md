## Description

This is a project assigned by DEPTÂ® to Juli Scapucin for recruitment process purposes.

It uses:

1 [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

2 Wordpress back-end, hosted at http://dept.wordpresssites.host/wp-admin

3 Front-end hosted at http://dept.juliscapucin.com/ on Digital Ocean

4 Maison Neue Trial font from Milieu Grotesque (https://www.milieugrotesque.com/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
